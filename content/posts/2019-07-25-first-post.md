Well, here we go...

## I've been at this awhile

I've blogged before, most recently on Medium.com, where I've posted several technical articles. However, Medium (just like YouTube), is looking at ways to monetize their (our) content. When this happens, the nature of the game changes.  I've noticed, as have others, that my posts are not reaching as wide an audience as before.

## Build your own, and crosspost like a daemon

The current mantra seems to be: create your own blog, then crosspost to other sites. Don't rely on blog sites alone, because you can't control what their focus will be. 

## And then there's the freedom

If you have your own blog, under your own domain, where you control the layout and format and feature set, it's more in tune with the content you wish to produce. And, I'm not limited to technical topics. I can post limericks if I want, though I will have to figure out how to allow subscribers technical stuff to opt out of the fluff. Assuming I figure out how to get a subscription service running.

## But it's more work

I'm not hosting my own server, thank goodness, but I am using a framework for web site generation, and a CMS (though not strictly necessary) that my most service provides. Whenever you use a framework, you have to adapt framework-think, and not try to work _around_ the framework. So there's a learning curve there that I'm just now getting on top of.

## In the end

This site will be the fount of all my wisdom and foolishness. Little rivulets will flow from it.
