description: In the wake of editor Alexi McCammond's recent resignation from
  Teen Vogue because of racist comments made when she was 17, it raises further
  questions about the so-called cancel culture's arbitrary and ever-evolving
  boundaries of what is unforgivable.

When Alexi McCammond was 17, she had recently won a full scholarship to Guilford College. She had intended since the age of 4 to become a doctor, but her father's loss of his job curbed those plans, but through hard work she secured the means to move on acedemally.  Though she didn't fulfill her childhood dream, she went on to become Senior Political Editor at Axios, and made many appearances on MSNBC as a pundit.\
\
Alexi was not new to recent controversy.  President Biden's blah Press Liason had been pressured to resign a month previously when it was found out he was dating Ms. McCammond, and had threatened the reporter who was about to make that public knowledge. Later, McCammond accepted a position as editor of Teen Vogue magazine, a Conde Nast publication. \
\
It seems there were some political repurcussions to that hiring.  McCammond had no previous editorial experience, and it may have bred some resentment among the staff.  Regardless, a deep-dive into her twitter postings show that McCammond made some racially insensitive remarks about Asians and Jews. 

Despite her acknowledgement and apologies, the damage was done. Exacerbating it was the recent murder of eight people, six of them Asian, by a gunman "having a bad day".  The person most directly responsible for growing violence towards Asian-Americans is of course former President Donald Trump, and his conspiricy claims of China's responsibility for the Covid-19 plague devestating economies around the world.

## Upbringing is not everything

If we were bound by our upbringing and peer-pressure, then what Alexi tweeted at 17 should forever condemn her future career prospects. As human beings, though, most of us grow and change.  Not always for the better, but most people to want to be fair and honest and learn. If I had grown up with a different set of parents (I know nothing about McCammond's) or raised in a neighborhood where racism was openly tolerated to some degree, I would have to had the opportunity to step back from that and reexamine my beliefs, and hopefully come to realize that racism is a way to suppress and exclude a class of people from opportunity and fairness under the law.  That's by no means a given. \
\
Fortunately, my parents did not tolerate racism of any kind. My mother grew up desparately poor, and both parents were not far removed form the Irish and Italian generation that first immigrated to this country, and faced discrimination themselves. 

## Rehabilitation

Many of the mistakes we make are not irredeemable, but some are.  Flunk out of high school, and the road ahead for you becomes steeper and less sure.  Fail your driver's test, though, and you unlimited chances to try again.

McCammond landed a very prestigious position at a young age. She is by no means privileged and undeserving from that perspective. Even though
