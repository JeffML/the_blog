I'm either comfortably retired or unemployed, I haven't decided which. What I do know is that I am not yet ready for decades of hard-won knowledge to lie fallow. I am still driven to learn new technologies, and it seems to get better all the time (I swear I am not an optimist by nature).  Now I have the time to work on what interests me, and at my own pace.

The rate of change in technologies has increased markedly since I started my career writing code in a 4GL. The UI back then utilized extended ASCII, 80 characters wide and 50 lines long.  It was a much simpler environment then, and I could whip out a reasonable custom departmental application in a week (though back then an "easy" week was 80 hours). Changes to operating systems, languages and hardware did happen, but on a scale of months or even years.

I later moved from MS-DOS, to Unix, to Windows, to Unix again, to Mac OS, and now I'm back to Unix (Crostini).  Whereas I used to write applications, now I write websites.  I no longer code in C++ or Java, but mostly in JavaScript now. I considered myself very expert at C++, SQL and XML; now I mostly work with NoSQL, GraphQL, JSON and a bit of YAML. Though competent in many areas, I don't strive for the same level of expertise because the rate of change invalidates old methods and technologies quickly.

## "Ok, Boomer, so what's the point?"

First of all, I'm Generation Jones. So watch it, kid. 

What I'm getting around to is that just about every former colleague I'm in touch with that excelled at programming is still programming. To be able to do that for decades, you have to remain open-minded and adaptable, because the technological rug gets pulled out from under you _all the time_.  Learning does get a little bit harder the older you get (the memory's intact, but the recall's a bit sketchy). To compensate, experience gives an inkling as to how all the new jigsaw pieces fit together, and how to spot a fad or a failure a mile away.

## "What does this have to do with writing?"

Okay! I'm getting there...jeez.

I've just admitted I'm not so much an expert on on anything anymore. However, with all the new techs popping up every five minutes, there's plenty of bleeding-edge stuff that _nobody_ is an expert on,  and that there is a niche, my friend. To exploit it is to learn, research, suffer, take notes, more research, suffer some more, give up, **stubbornly** try again, and eventually succeed.  That is called _experience,_ which is not the same as expertise, but it is valuable nonetheless. 

When I start to learn about something new, I cast a world-wide net (web?) looking for somebody, _somewhere_ that can clue me in as to what I should be doing.  Should I wind up empty-handed, I know that that somebody is going to be _me._ So I start working it out on my own, cursing the entire way.

Sometimes it's in the documentation, but for new stuff the docs are either: 1) missing; 2) lying; 3) incomplete; or 4) unfathomable.  So then I have to ask newbie questions on forums and technical support message boards, trying not to sound like an idiot (which is generally assumed by the by those responding). If I still don't get an answer, I know that I'm _really_ on the bleeding edge.  Just so you know, I _hate_ the bleeding edge; the **bloody** edge is fine--that's just a bit back from the bleeding one. Life is not near so exasperating on the bloody edge.

## "So you admit you are an impostor."

Well, yeah, but hold on just a one sec...

I don't dissuade my readers from thinking I'm an expert, but I do drop hints that I just _might_ be learning this stuff as I go along. This brings me around to my penultimate point: the process of writing about something forces me to _learn it better._ I'm okay with being an _imposteur_ (fancier French word that sounds cooler than it is), but I don't want to be a _dummkopf_ (German word that sounds exactly like it's meaning). So I try **hard** not to write something totally wrong and stupid. Sometimes I make a bad assumption or overlook some side-effect, but if you're _too_ scared of embarrassing yourself, you miss the opportunity to get a deeper and more complete understanding.  Your occasional and little \_dummkopf\_ errors are pointed out to you in comments,  acknowledge, correct, and move on. Everybody goofs, even the experts.

Finally, writing offers the opportunity for readers to _learn something faster than author did._ We should all follow DRY principles, shouldn't we?  There's no reason for some other poor fool to make the exact same errors that you, the writer, already made _for_ them.

So try it!  If you're not a good writer, and good editor will help you become one.  I recommend Hemingway as a start. Most of all: Thank you, Dear Reader, for allowing me to share!
