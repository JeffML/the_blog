I'm either retired or comfortably unemployed, I haven't decided which. What I do know is that I am not ready for my decades of hard-won knowledge to go fallow, and I am still driven to learn new technologies, because it keeps getting better all the time (am I a closet optimist? I shudder to think!).  Now is the time I can work on what interests me, albeit at a smaller scale, and a less hectic pace. It is rather enjoyable.

The rate of change in technologies has increased markedly since when I start writing code in a 4GL that used extended ASCII for the UI.  Life was so much simpler then. I could whip out a full custom departmental application in a week, no sweat (although back then an "easy" week was 80 hours). Change did happen, but on a scale of months or even years.

I later moved from MS-DOS, to Unix, to Windows, to Unix again, to Mac OS, and now back to Unix (Crostini).  I used to write applications, now I write websites.  I once coded in C++ or Java, now it's mostly JavaScript.  I used to know C++, SQL and XML in considerable depth, but now I mostly work with NoSQL, GraphQL, JSON and a bit of YAML.  Though I still have passable working knowledge of both old and new technologies,  I don't consider myself an expert at anything anymore.

## "Ok, Boomer, so what's the point?" 

Well, first of all, I'm Generation Jones, **so watch it!** 

What I'm getting around to is that just about every former colleague I'm in touch with that excelled at programming is still programming. And to do that for decades, you have to remain open-minded, because the technological rug gets pulled out from under you _all the time_.  Learning does get a little bit harder at my age, but experience has at least given me an inkling as to where all the new jigsaw pieces go.

## "What does this have to do with writing?"

Okay! I'm getting there...jeez.

I've just admitted I'm not an expert on much of anything anymore. However, with all the new techs popping up every five minutes, there's plenty of bleeding-edge stuff that _nobody_ is an expert on.  And that's a niche:  learn, suffer, take notes, suffer some more, give up, **stubbornly** try again, and eventually succeed.  This is called _experience,_ which is not the same as expertise, but it is valuable nonetheless. 

When I start to learn about something new, I cast a world-wide net (web?) looking for somebody, _somewhere_ that can clue me in as to what I should be doing.  If wind up empty-handed, I know that that somebody is going to be _me._ So I start working it out on my own, cursing the entire way.

Sometimes it's in the documentation, but for new stuff the docs are either: 1) missing; 2) lying; 3) incomplete; or 4) unfathomable.  So then I have to ask newbie questions on forums and technical support message boards, trying not to sound like an idiot (which is generally assumed by the persons responding). If I still don't get an answer, I know that I'm _really_ on the bleeding edge.  I _hate_ the bleeding edge; the **bloody** edge is fine--that's just back from the bleeding one. That's my happy place.

## "So you are an impostor."

Well, yeah, but hold on just a sec...

I don't dissuade readers from thinking I'm an expert, but I do drop hints that I just _might_ be learning this stuff as I go along. And this brings me around to my penultimate point: the process of writing about something forces me to _learn it better._ I'm okay with being an _imposteur_, but I don't want to be a dunderhead. So I try **hard** not to write something totally wrong and stupid. Sometimes I make a bad assumption or overlook some side-effect, but if you're _too_ scared of embarrassing yourself, you miss the opportunity to learn (and correct, and further elucidate) something that may not be all that obvious. To anyone.

And finally, writing is an offer of the opportunity to readers to _learn something faster than author did._ We should all follow DRY principles, shouldn't we?  There's no reason for some other poor fool to make the exact same errors that I already made _for them_.

So try it!  If you're not a good writer, and good editor will help you become one.  I recommend Hemingway as a start. Oh, and thanks ahead of time for saving me from painful experience.
