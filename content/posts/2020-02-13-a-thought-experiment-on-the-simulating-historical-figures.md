# The idea

My thought keep coming around to a fantasy where I am able to bring back some of the founding fathers of the  United States into the present time. The possibility of doing that is nil, but more probably is simulating the founding fathers. After all, many did write copiously, so with a little deep learning it might just be possible to simulate the thought processes and emotional makeup of Franklin, Madison, Adams, Jefferson, and Hamilton, and Washington. 

Let's take it one step further and say that technology has advanced sufficiently that we can place these simulations in a human-like body with senses of smell, taste, hearing, and touch. 

## Culture Shock

To avoid immediate culture shock, let's further restrict their initial encounter with the present day by placing them in a remote cabin in the woods. Some modern conveniences could be allowed, such as plumbing and even electricity (though care would be taken to introduce electrical appliances and such gradually).

As you might guess, I am concerned that they're not inundated with all of modernity in one go. I think it would be too overwhelming. The cabin would in essence be a classroom, where a bit of the modern gradually seeps in.  

## To be or not to be, that is their question

The reason this fantasy appeals to me is selfish:  I want to see their reaction as they gradually come into the world.  I think it would be a positive experience for both the simulations and myself.  I could be wrong.

One of the first questions that needs to be resolved is: Are they aware that they are simulations? After all, we want them to believe they are the actual historical figures from a time long ago.  Or do we just want them to _feel_ like they are?  There is a dichotomy between feeling and knowing: many of us have been in love and idolized the object of our affection, all the while knowing no lover survives untarnished over time. Yet love often prevails.

To make a simulation believe they are the real thing seems cruel.  For one thing, we wouldn't be able to fill out the memories of their childhoods in any sort of detail.  Either they'd have to be made up of whole cloth, or be missing.  Surely not memory of childhood would be noticed by our founding fathers. 

So I think the best thing is to tell them they are simulations, ones that we are confident are close enough to the real founding fathers. What would their reaction be? Assuming they, like you and me, are enjoying the experience of life, and are curious about the present, I think the experiment would continue with everyone on board. Yet, each simulated person should have the ability to "opt out"-- otherwise it would be like I kidnapped them from the 1700's and brought them here into the 2020's.  

If they're all at desks, like schoolchildren learning about the wonders of the modern world, maybe we place a red button atop it that basically allow each of them to obliviate themselves if they so choose. If the simulated Thomas Jefferson just doesn't feel comfortable about the situation or their just _being_, then we can't hold them their by force. Press the button, and TJ can dismiss himself from existence (again).

But is that button always an option? I think as time goes on, each simulation becomes more invested in the present time and in present relationships, so any desire to press the button might indicate transient depression or anxiety, not to mention that their loss would be emotionally tragic to those continuing on.

# What if they just don't like the present?

Certainly, that is going to happen.  There is so much that has changed technologically, but let's not forget societal changes have occurred as well.  Women have fought, and are still fighting, for equality. Sexual mores have definitely changed. Politics have changed, for better or worse. The United States, once a struggling backwater of a country, is at present the most powerful in the world (that would blow our founding fathers' minds!).

So that's expecting a lot.  One would have to question whether the whole experiment could ever be made ethical, if we consider the simulations to be in charge of their own destiny once we place them in the present. The more I think about it, the more see how selfish the whole concept is.

Imagine, for instance, that _you_ are a simulation.  I'm no Elon Musk, or a rockstar, or President.  That kind of irritates me, if I'm a simulation.  Why this obscure life? Who's idea was this?

And so it may be for our simulations, even if they are aware they're simulated. They may just not like being here, unknown and unaccomplished.
